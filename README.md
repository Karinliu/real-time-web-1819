### My concept
My concept is to let a user search for a hashtag. From these search results a random image will be displayed.

When user 1 and user 2 both searched for a hashtag with the related images, the images will be merged together. 

### API
First I wanted to use the instagram api. but the disadvantage of using this api was that I could only retrieve the data from my own account 

Then I made the choice to use a Tumblr API. 

##### Rate limit
The rate limit for the API is 1,000 requests per hour, and 5,000 requests per day.


#### Authorisation
Tumblr supports OAuth for authentication.

### Feedback
• Data life cycle (interaction between client and server is correct).
